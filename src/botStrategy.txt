bot strategy by using the following algorithm:

1. If the bot's hand value is less than or equal to 11, it should always hit, as there is no risk of busting.

2. If the bot's hand value is between 12 and 16, it should hit if the player's upcard is 14 or higher, as the player is likely to have a strong hand. Otherwise, the bot should stay.

3. If the bot's hand value is 17 or more, it has 30% hit, 70% stay, as the risk of busting becomes higher.
